     <p class="special-highlight"> Habitat:</p>
     <p>
        Necrovines are often found in dark, damp, and abandoned places, such as desolate alien landscapes. They thrive in areas where decay and rot are prevalent, often feeding off the remnants of dead organisms or corrupted energy fields.

         The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
         terrestrial
         animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa
         camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant
         species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements.
         Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the
         story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your creature.)
