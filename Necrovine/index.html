                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Necrovines are often found in dark, damp, and abandoned places, such as desolate alien landscapes. They thrive in areas where decay and rot are prevalent, often feeding off the remnants of dead organisms or corrupted energy fields.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Necrovine is an alien-human-like creature with a deformed body, veiny skin, and antennas on its head, radiating a barely-living, eerie vibe. Its gray-blueish color palette, with cold, lifeless shades, gives it a chilling appearance that seems to blur the line between the natural and unnatural.</p>

                Necrovine's origins begin far from Earth, as it hails from an unknown world. Upon arriving on Earth—by latching onto a spacecraft—it sought survival by jumping from host to host, parasitically using humans or animals to sustain itself. Each new host brought Necrovine closer to understanding Earth's biology, but its presence also left destruction in its wake, as hosts would deteriorate due to its unstable nature.

Eventually, Necrovine was captured by scientists in a high-security lab. Intrigued by its alien physiology and potential, they began conducting experiments on it, dissecting its abilities and attempting to manipulate its organism. However, the more they interfered, the more unpredictable and dangerous Necrovine became, leading to further mutation and its barely-living, eerie appearance. Now, it exists as a twisted fusion of alien biology and human manipulation, struggling to regain control or escape.
